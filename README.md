# Z Invaders
Inspired by the classic Space Invaders game, Z Invaders is a Dragon Ball Z game where Goku must defeat the villains before they enter Planet Kai and reach him.
The Dragon Ball Z villains are randomised and for each villain defeated, the player receives 10 points. Once the current level ends, the player gets a bonus of 100 points for each alien they defeated in the previous level.
Players can defeat the villains by moving Goku with the arrow keys and shooting blasts with the spacebar.
The villains are grouped into columns and rows and move from side to side. Once a villain hits the side of the window, the whole group of villains move down one column. The game ends once a villain enters Planet Kai and is on the same row as Goku.
